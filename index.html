<p>W3C is pleased to announce the report from the W3C Workshop on Wide Color Gamut and High Dynamic Range for the Web, held online in July-September 2021.

This report contains an executive summary, introduces the subject area, discusses major topics from the live sessions, links to the presentation videos and session minutes, and details next steps that were taken, and continue to be explored, after the workshop.

The workshop connected the color science, content creation and web platform communities and explored the current, ongoing transition of the web platform from the legacy sRGB, narrow gamut, standard dynamic range world of the previous quarter century, through wide color gamut, and onto high dynamic range.
